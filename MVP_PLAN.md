# Piarcha MVP Plan

## Vision

A semi-social mobile app for solo travelers. Download AI-generated tours for the city you're visiting, follow them on an interactive map, and meet fellow travelers along the way.

---

## Current State

### What Works
- Auth flow (login, register, token persistence)
- Interactive map with geolocation tracking and tour stop markers
- Nearest-stop detection — map auto-selects the closest attraction to user
- Walking/biking travel time estimation (Haversine-based, offline)
- Route drawing on map via `react-native-maps-directions` (requires Google Maps API key)
- Walk/Bike mode toggle with live time display in bottom panel
- Tour detail screen with travel time between consecutive stops
- Locations service (countries, cities, attractions) on Express + MongoDB
- User service (Fastify + MongoDB) with location tracking and search
- Token generation (Rust/Rocket) + JWT verification service
- Admin panel (React, early stage)
- Shared TypeScript interfaces package

### What's Broken or Missing
- All page source files deleted from disk (staged deletions in git)
- Hardcoded localhost URLs, Google Maps API key not yet configured in `.env`
- Friends and Inbox screens show dummy data only
- No messaging infrastructure
- No AI integration
- No offline support
- No environment configuration (.env)

## Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Frontend framework | Expo (`piarcha-expo`) | OTA updates, EAS Build, push notifications out of the box, simpler dev setup |
| AI tour generation | Extend `piarch-a-locations` with `/generate-tour` endpoint calling Claude API | Tour schema and attraction data already live here; no need for a separate service |
| Real-time chat | Firebase Firestore or Supabase | No need to build WebSocket infra for MVP |
| Offline maps | MapLibre + pre-cached tiles or Google Maps tile caching | Critical for travelers on spotty connections |
| State management | Zustand or Redux Toolkit | Current vanilla Redux is too verbose; RTK Query or Zustand simplifies data fetching |
| Deployment | Railway or Fly.io + MongoDB Atlas | Cheap, simple, production-ready |

## Phase 0 — Foundation Cleanup

**Goal:** Get the app bootable, buildable, and deployable.
**Duration:** 1-2 weeks

### Tasks

- [ ] Set up environment configuration (`.env` files for all services)
- [ ] Replace all hardcoded localhost URLs with environment variables
- [ ] Configure valid Google Maps API key (code reads from `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`; needs `.env` file with actual key)
- [ ] Fix TypeScript issues — remove `@ts-ignore` comments, replace `any` types
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline (lint + type-check + build)
- [ ] Dockerize backend services (Docker Compose for local dev)
- [ ] Deploy backend to staging (Railway/Fly.io + MongoDB Atlas)
- [ ] Verify end-to-end auth flow works on a real device

### Deliverable
App launches, user can register, log in, and see a map with their location.

## Phase 1 — Core Solo Traveler Experience

**Goal:** A traveler arrives in a city and explores it with AI-generated tours.
**Duration:** 3-4 weeks

### 1.1 City Discovery

- [ ] City discovery screen — browse featured cities, search by name
- [ ] City detail screen — photo, description, attraction count, available tours
- [ ] Connect to existing `/countryList`, `/cityList`, `/coordinates` endpoints
- [ ] Add city images and metadata to the locations database

### 1.2 AI Tour Generation

> **Existing infrastructure (`piarch-a-locations` on port 3019):**
> - Location schema already has `tours[]` embedded per city (`tourName`, `shortDescription`, `tourType`)
> - GET `/tours/:city` endpoint exists but is **not implemented** (TODO)
> - GET `/coordinates/:city` already returns attractions with descriptions
> - Seeded data: Istanbul (5 attractions, 3 tours), Barcelona (5, 3), Havana (5, 0), Doha (5, 0)
> - `TourType` enum: Bike, Hike, Trekking
> - `AttractionType` enum: Church, Column, Museum, Shop, Palace, Mosque, Cistern, House, Square, Park, Castle, Information

- [ ] **Implement GET `/tours/:city`** in `piarch-a-locations` — return existing manual tours
- [ ] **Extend tour schema** to support AI-generated tours:
  - Add `stops[]` array to tour (ordered list of coordinates with sequence number)
  - Add `estimatedDuration`, `distanceKm`, `generatedBy` (manual | ai) fields
  - Add `preferences` field (interests, pace, accessibility)
- [ ] **Add POST `/generate-tour`** endpoint to `piarch-a-locations`:
  - Accepts: city, preferences (walking/biking, duration, interests)
  - Fetches city's existing coordinates/attractions from DB
  - Calls Claude API with attractions + preferences as context
  - Returns ordered tour with stops, descriptions, and estimated times
  - Caches generated tour in the same `tours[]` array for reuse
- [ ] Tour generation UI — select preferences, generate, preview
- [x] Tour detail screen — ordered stop list, total distance, estimated duration
  - Shows walking/biking travel time between consecutive stops (Haversine estimate)

### 1.3 Interactive Map (Upgrade)

- [x] Display tour route on map with numbered stop markers
  - All tour stops shown as colored markers (nearest = purple, others = red)
- [x] Draw walking/biking route between stops (directions API)
  - Integrated `react-native-maps-directions` (`MapViewDirections`) to draw actual road route
  - Walk/Bike toggle changes route color (green for walk, blue for bike)
  - Requires `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` in `.env` for route drawing
  - Falls back to Haversine-based estimate when API key is absent
- [x] Nearest-stop detection — automatically finds the closest tour stop to user's current location
  - Uses Haversine formula with 1.3x road factor for distance estimation
  - `findNearest()` and `sortByNearest()` utilities in `utils/travel-time.ts`
- [x] Travel time display — bottom panel shows walking/biking minutes to next stop
  - Shows Google Directions API duration when available, Haversine estimate otherwise
- [ ] Current stop detection via proximity (< 50m triggers "arrived" state)
- [ ] Stop detail bottom sheet — description, photo, "mark as visited"
- [ ] Tour progress indicator (3/8 stops visited)

### 1.4 Offline Support (Basic)

- [ ] "Download tour" button — saves tour data locally (AsyncStorage or SQLite)
- [ ] Cache map tiles for the tour area
- [ ] Offline indicator in UI
- [ ] Downloaded tours accessible without network

### Deliverable
User selects a city, generates or picks a tour, downloads it, and follows it on the map while walking through the city.

---

## Phase 2 — Social Layer for Solo Travelers

**Goal:** Travelers in the same city can discover and message each other.
**Duration:** 3-4 weeks

### 2.1 Traveler Presence

- [ ] "I'm in [City]" opt-in toggle — makes user visible to others
- [ ] Backend: query users currently in the same city (extend `/user/search/closestUsers`)
- [ ] "Travelers nearby" list on city screen — show name, photo, distance
- [ ] Show nearby travelers on map with distinct marker style
- [ ] Privacy controls: visible to all / friends only / invisible

### 2.2 Traveler Profiles

- [ ] Public profile view (extend existing `/public-user/:username`)
- [ ] "Currently in [City]" badge on profile
- [ ] "Send message" button on public profiles

### 2.3 Messaging

- [ ] Set up Firebase Firestore (or Supabase) for real-time messaging
- [ ] Unread message count badge
- [ ] Push notifications for new messages (Expo Notifications)
- [ ] Basic moderation: report and block users

### 2.4 Meetup Nudges

- [ ] "X travelers are near [Attraction]" passive notification
- [ ] "Want to do this tour together?" — share tour invite via message
- [ ] Shared tour view: see each other's progress on the map

### Deliverable
User can see other travelers in the same city, view profiles, send messages, and invite someone to join a tour.

## Phase 3 — Polish and Launch Prep

**Goal:** Make it feel like a real product ready for the app store.
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks

### 3.1 Onboarding

- [ ] 3-screen onboarding explaining the app's value
- [ ] "Pick your first city" prompt after signup
- [ ] Permission requests (location, notifications) with context

### 3.2 Notifications

- [ ] Push notifications: new message, nearby traveler, tour suggestion
- [ ] In-app notification center
- [ ] Notification preferences in settings

### 3.3 Quality and Safety

- [ ] Error boundaries on all screens
- [ ] Loading states and skeleton screens
- [ ] Empty states with helpful prompts
- [ ] Rate limiting on messaging endpoints
- [ ] Content moderation basics (report user, block user)
- [ ] GDPR: location consent, data export, account deletion

### 3.4 Analytics

- [ ] Event tracking (PostHog or Mixpanel)
- [ ] Key events: tour generated, tour started, tour completed, message sent, traveler discovered
- [ ] Crash reporting (Sentry)

### 3.5 App Store

- [ ] Store screenshots and description
- [ ] TestFlight / Play Store internal testing track
- [ ] Privacy policy and terms of service

### Deliverable
App is on TestFlight and Play Store internal track, ready for beta testers.
